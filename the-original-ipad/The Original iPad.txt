The Original iPad
The iPad was the first popular mobile tablet of its kind. It was designed specifically for people who needed a mobile device that was larger than a smartphone, but smaller than a laptop.

The iPad looks similar to other handheld tablet devices. It is approximately the size of a sheet of paper and weighs at around 500 grams. The touchscreen display is 9.7” high-resolution Retina IPS LCD display.

The original iPad had Bluetooth 4 and WiFi 4 capabilities, but suprisingly had no camera. Apple added a camera to the iPad in 2011 with the release of the iPad 2. It only came in black, and had a best-case-scenario battery life of 10 hours. The storage options available for the iPad were 16GB, 32GB and 64GB, with optional 3G cellular connectivity.

The iPad came with iPhone OS 3.3 and can be upgraded up to iOS 5.1.1 via iTunes on a PC or Mac or OTA from versions of iOS newer than 5.0.
